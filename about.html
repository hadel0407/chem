<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p>
This personal chemical engineering website focuses on applying <strong>fundamental theory to solve real-world production problems</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Our mission is to help chemical and process engineers understand how thermodynamics, phase equilibrium, and mass transfer principles can be practically applied in industrial systems.
</p>

<p>
Articles emphasize <strong>practical assumptions, boundary conditions, and limitations</strong> of commonly used formulas, particularly under non-ideal and real operating conditions.
</p>

<p>
Content is designed for engineers, students, and professionals seeking to <strong>bridge theory and practice</strong>, improve efficiency, troubleshoot processes, and optimize chemical production safely.
</p>

<p>
All material is provided for <strong>educational and professional knowledge exchange</strong>.
