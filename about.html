## About This Site

This personal chemical engineering website focuses on applying **fundamental theory to solve real-world production problems**. 

Our mission is to help chemical and process engineers understand how thermodynamics, phase equilibrium, and mass transfer principles can be practically applied in industrial systems. 

Articles emphasize **practical assumptions, boundary conditions, and limitations** of commonly used formulas, particularly under non-ideal and real operating conditions. 

Content is designed for engineers, students, and professionals seeking to **bridge theory and practice**, improve efficiency, troubleshoot processes, and optimize chemical production safely. 

All material is provided for **educational and professional knowledge exchange**.
