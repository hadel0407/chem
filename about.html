## About This Site

This is a personal technical website focused on solving **practical problems in chemical production** using **fundamental chemical engineering theory**.

The goal of this site is to help chemical engineers better understand how theoretical laws—such as thermodynamics, phase equilibrium, and mass transfer—apply to real industrial systems.

Articles emphasize practical assumptions, boundary conditions, and limitations of commonly used formulas, especially in non-ideal and real-world operating conditions.

This site is intended for chemical engineers, process engineers, and students who want to apply theory effectively in daily production, troubleshooting, and optimization work.

All content is shared for educational and knowledge-exchange purposes.
